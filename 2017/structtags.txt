Writing a Go Tool to Parse and Modify Struct Tags

https://github.com/fatih/structtag

TL;DR;

  - Nice project but I don't think it justified a full talk
  - Ingredient in IDE tool https://github.com/fatih/gomodifytags
  - Showcased some useful tools for processing Go code (parser and format
    packages)
