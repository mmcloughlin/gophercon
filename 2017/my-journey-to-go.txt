Contributing

  "Contributing is not just about code"

  Don't have to be Rob Pike!

  Small contribution is better than no contribution.

  Best project to contribute to is one you're already using.

  What are you good at right now?

  Listening: mailing lists, blogs, irc, reddit, ...

Tickets

  Diagnosing bugs

  Closing fixed tickets

Code

  Test a beta release

  Fix a bug

  Write a test

Docs. Docs. Docs.

  Often written my heaviest users. So from the wrong perspective.

Community

  - Answer a question
  - Write a blog post, even if it's silly
  - Improve a website

  "We are a community of coders, but if all we do is code we've lost the
  community."
