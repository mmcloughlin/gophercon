Going Serverless


Intro

  New way of thinking about compute.

  Poor naming. "Serverless" becoming diluted.


Functions

  Example of xinetd, to help you write a daemon.

  - Your "service" reads and writes from stdin/stdout
  - Then xinetd handles the connections and networking
  - xinetd handles the lifecycle

  Think of "serverless" like this.

  Functions:

    Perform a specific task.

  Events:

    Response to something else that happens in the cloud.

  Managed Services

    Pay per use. Fully managed.

  Two classic cases:

    Rest API
    Data Pipeline
