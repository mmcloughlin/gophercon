Go 2

  Main requests:

  - package management
  - error handling
  - generics

  The Go team is serious on all three fronts.


Modules

  Still experimental

  Year or two for the entire system to be adapated to support them.


Error Handling

  Too much:

    if err != nil {
      return nil, err
    }

  Verbose, and doesn't add any context.

  Proposal:

    "check" statement

  With a "handle" block that explains how to handle the result of a check
  statement.


Generics

  Do we infer which types can be used from the implementation?

  In the draft design, a "contract" specifies which capabilities the generic
  type must have.
