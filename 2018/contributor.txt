Becoming a Contributor


Contribute by Using Go

  Could be using it more
  Write a new service
  Use it in ways it's not typically used... report back

  Notice confusion:

  - Notice when things do not match expectation

  Example: confusing error/bug in mail package

  Would it be embarassing or pointless to fix this edge case?

  - 1.1 million Go developers
  - 1% use mail package
  - 1% hit the edge case
  - that's still 110 people


File Bug Reports

  What were you trying to do?
  What did you expect to see?
  What did you see?
  How can I reproduce it?

  The last one is critical!


Contribute Reduced Test Cases

  Reproduces the error 100% of the time
  Small, fast program
  Common-ish OS


Reduced Test Cases can Suggest Contributions

  In the process, you can begin to figure out where the problem really is.


Contribute Examples

  People don't read on the internet

  Examples have high information density.

  The "fmt" package has one example.


Contribute Documentation

  Example "scrypt" package.

  One function. Documentation for it gives parameters for 2009.

  File issue: for visibility. So people can find it via Google.


Contribute to golang.org/x repos

  Experimental.

  Contribution process is a little less rigorous.

  Examples:

    gopherbot is in x/build
    trybots GUI is awful


How do you get started?

  Lower your expectations

  Should be small, so you can get comfortable with all the other aspects.

  No change is too small.

  Over half of Brad Fitz's commits are under 20 lines

  Small commits open the door to larger involvement.

Help

  golang-dev mailing list
  #gocontributing / #goreview on Slack
  Post the CL and explain where you got stuck
  It's OK to make mistakes

  If people get stuck, that's on the Go team too


Should you Contribute?

  OSS is (largely) free labor
  It might be worth it!
